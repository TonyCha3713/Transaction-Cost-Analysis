This project is a C++ Transaction Cost Analysis (TCA) toolkit for quantitative trading. It calculates hidden trading costs through an Implementation Shortfall analysis, calibrates market-impact parameters such as the temporary impact slope (η), and then uses those estimates to generate an optimized execution schedule that balances cost and risk while respecting participation-of-volume caps. The unified tca command-line interface can perform each step—analyzing historical fills, fitting impact models, optimizing future orders, and producing JSON/CSV reports—making it both a learning exercise in clean, efficient C++ design and a practical demonstration of how professional quant trading teams reduce execution costs.
